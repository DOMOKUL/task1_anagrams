#Task 2 - Unit tests

Write JUnit tests for the previous application.

JUnit 5 should be used.

In the future, all tasks are done with the Unit tests

1.In order to make tests more useful, name them in the way you read the documentation. For example: reverseOnlyLetters_shouldReturnSameAmountOfSpaces_whenInputStringContainsOnlySpaces. Yes, it is too long and you shouldn't name the src methods in this way. This approach will help you(or somebody) in the future during refactoring or logic change.

2.The pattern is the next: methodName_shouldDoSmth_whenConditions

3.Check null

4.Check empty string

5.Check single space input

6.Check several spaces input

7.Check single character input

8.Check multiple same letter input

9.Check the same character in lower and upper cases mixed in the input

10.Check a word with different letters

11.Check only symbols

12.check several words.
